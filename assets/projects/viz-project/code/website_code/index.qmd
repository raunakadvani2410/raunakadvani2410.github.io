# The Data Job Market in the US {#home}



```{python}
#| echo: false

# libraries
from IPython.display import display, HTML, IFrame

```

## Introduction {#introduction}

The job market in the US has been quite unstable recently, with companies, especially technology ones, firing employees left, right and center in order to reduce costs and human power. To add on to that, widespread inflation in the US has led to jobs overpaying several employees, which is another contributing factor to mass layoffs in the technology sector. This project is an attempt to portray a deep dive into the market for data-related jobs in the US, by means of effective data visualizations. We will explore several features of jobs, including their salary, experience, qualifications, and locations, and we will do this in a visually informative manner. I hope you enjoy my project. 

## What Jobs? Where do they come from?

In this section, we will first look at some of the higher-level information of the jobs available to us, before diving deeper into the nitty-gritty details. We will look at the cities and states with the most jobs, and also explore common job titles and search engines.

### Number of Job Results by US State  {#sec-geo-plot-2 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-geo-2
#| fig-cap: "shows a geospatial map depicting the number of job searches per US state, for which job data is available."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-16.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Top 5 Cities with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-1 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-1
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the 5 most frequent locations, and the number of times they appear in the search."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-1.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Top 5 Search Engines with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-2 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-2
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the 5 most frequent job posters, and the number of times they appear in the search."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-2.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Count of the Search Query, by Degree Required {#sec-grouped-bar-plot .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-grouped-bar-plot
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the search queries, and the number of times they appear based on the degree required."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-4.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```


From the above plots, we see that:
<ul>
<li> The distribution of jobs among different states is not uniform. We notice that states such as New York, California and the District of Columbia have the most jobs, which is a pattern that we would expect to see, given that half of our job searches come from the DMV, and given that California and New York are both hubs for technology and business alike. </li>
<li> In terms of cities, New York and Washington reign supreme, and surprisingly enough, San Francisco comes in with the third most jobs of our dataset. </li>
<li> The majority of our jobs come from LinkedIn, which is a very popular job search engine. </li>
</ul>


## What do you need? What do you get?

The data domain is indubitably a lucrative domain to be in, which is why jobs are hard to find and secure. While the pay and lifestyle is lavish, breaking into the industry and securing a job takes a lot more than simply a degree related to a data-related subject. Therefore, in this section, we will explore jobs requirements, such as minimum degrees and years of experience, and also explore the perks that come with jobs, including high salaries and opportunities to work from home.

Let's explore the average salaries and experience required for data-related jobs, for each state. @fig-interactive-table:

### Table of Average Yearly Pay and Experience Required, by state  {#sec-table .unnumbered}

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-interactive-table
#| fig-cap: "shows an interactive table with an option to select between average yearly salary and experience required by state."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/table.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

::: {.callout-note}
From the above **interactive data table**, we can gain a better understanding into whether different states look for different levels of experience or pay differing amounts in salaries to employees. Note that some values in the table may be skewed due to limited job postings for some states.

### Salaries for Years of Experience Required  {#sec-scatt-plot .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-scat-plot
#| fig-cap: "shows the relationship between experience required and salary, by degree required."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-8.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Distribution of Job Salaries {#sec-hist-plot .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: "shows a histogram of the salaries of job results from the search."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-5.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Distribution of Required Job Experience {#sec-hist-plot-2 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-hist-2
#| fig-cap: "shows a histogram of the years of experience required in job results from the search."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-6.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Average Salaries for Popular Locations {#sec-bp .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-5
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot depicting the average salaries for the most popular locations in the search."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-18.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Remote vs. In-person Jobs {#sec-pie-chart .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-pie-chart
#| fig-cap: "shows a pie chart with the distribution of the jobs results for whether they were in-person or remote."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-15.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Salaries for whether Remote Work is Permitted, segmented by Degree Required  {#sec-box-plot .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-box-plot
#| fig-cap: "shows the salaries for both in person and work from home jobs, by degree required."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-9.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Salaries for Years of Experience Required, grouped by Degree Required {#sec-grouped-plot .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-grouped-plot
#| fig-cap: "shows a grouped bar plot the salaries for varying years of experience, by degree required."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-10.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Word Cloud for Job Benefits {#cloud-3 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-cloud-3
#| fig-cap: "shows a word cloud for the most common words found in 'benefits'."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-14.png', width=width_percentage, height=600)

```

### Average Salaries for 5 Most Common Job Titles  {#sec-pop .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-4
#| fig-cap: "shows the average salaries for the 5 most popular job titles."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-7.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

So, what can we make from examining all the above plots? We see that:
<ul>
<li>In the datatable, the highest salaries are in states like New York and California, which is an expected result. This is likely due to the high tax rates and living costs in those states. We also notice a lot of states with no results, which can raise questions as to how representative the industry really is in terms of opportunities to work across the country.</li>
<li>Our word cloud yields several benefits that job seekers can potentially enjoy: parental leave, paid time off, and several different types of insurance including dental and vision.</li>
<li>The correlation plot between experience required and salary exhibits a medium strength positive correlation between experience and salary. However, upon manipulation of the plot, we notice that PhDs have a steeper rise in salary for an increase in experience, on average, than Bachelor's holders. Furthermore, we see that while jobs boast high salaries, averaging $150,000 to $200,000, they also expect, on average, 4-6 years of experience.</li>
<li>Exploring the remote work environment, the majority of jobs in our dataset do not include work from home options. We also see how in-person jobs, on average, have lower salaries than remote jobs, which is a surprising statistic. </li>
</ul>


## What skills are they looking for?

For this section, we'll look into other features of jobs, including the most popular titles, and the qualifications and responsibilities that are looked for. Since job sections like qualifications and responsibilities are normally sections that are filled with dense text, they are often overlooked by job-seekers. In fact, they contain the crucial elements of what the job-seeker should look to exhibit to their potential employer to maximize their chances of getting hired.

### Top 5 Job Titles with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-3 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-3
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the 5 most frequent job titles, and the number of times they appear in the search."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-3.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Word Cloud for Job Qualifications {#cloud-1 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-cloud-1
#| fig-cap: "shows a word cloud for the most common words found in 'qualifications'."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-12.png', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Word Cloud for Job Reponsibilities {#cloud-2 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-cloud-2
#| fig-cap: "shows a word cloud for the most common words found in 'responsibilities'."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-13.png', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Network between Job Titles and Queries {#network-1 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-network-1
#| fig-cap: "shows a NetworkX network connecting job queries and titles, depicting the extent of data-related jobs."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-17.png', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

Key takeaways from the above section:
<ul>
<li>`Data Scientist` and `Data Analyst` are the most common job titles from our entire search. This might indicate that more generalist positions are more readily available in the job market in comparison to other, more specialised positions.</li>
<li>Most of these are skills in the word cloud on qualifications are those that we'd expect to see: machine learning, big data, computer science, and deep learning.</li>
<li>The word cloud on responsibilities gives an overview of what a day to day on the job might look like: project, team, research, analysis, and development are words that can throw light on the daily job responsibilities.</li>
<li>Our network allows us to visualize the most common job titles and queries, elucidating the domains that are in high demand.</li>



## Conclusion

Through this visual project, we explored several facets of the current state of the market for data jobs in the US. We explored the data spatially, looking at which states had the most number of jobs available, and which states had the highest average salary. We also explored the most common cities and their average salaries. Some of the more insightful takeaways from a holistic view of the visualizations include:

<ul>
<li>Of the most common job titles, `Blockchain Engineer` and `Deep Learning Engineer` reigned supreme with the highest salaries, averaging `$166,000`per year.</li>
<li>Although they were the 2 most common job titles from the entire dataset, the job titles `Data Scientist` and `Data Analyst` had considerably lower salaries, averaging `$110,000` per year, which might indicate that taking up a job which requires specialization would lead to a higher pay. </li>
<li>However, most of these specialized jobs require at least a Master's and most often a PhD, degree, which tend to be an extreme expense in terms of time, tuition money, and foregone salary.</li>
<li> On the other hand, the benefits of having a PhD are also noticed with the steep increase in job salary for an increase in experience, in comparison to other degree holders. </li>
<li>Exploring remote and in-person options, we saw that while in-person jobs were a lot more available, remote jobs paid more, on average.</li>
</ul>
 
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the conclusions of this project are only limited to the data used for analysis, so it is difficult to establish causality or relationships for all job postings solely based off this particular dataset.

Thank you for taking the time to view my project. I hope you enjoyed going through it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
